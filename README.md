0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

In this project, we created a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter reads a bytecode file and executes the bytecode commands.

The Monty language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files 

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

Objectives: 
To know what LIFO and FIFO mean 
To know what a stack is, and when to use it 
To know what a queue is, and when to use it 
To know the common implementations of stacks and queues 
To know the most common use cases of stacks and queues 
To know the proper way to use global variables

Environment 
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS via Vagrant in VirtualBox and compiled with GCC version 4.8.4

Tasks

0. push, pall

push, pall The push opcode -The opcode push pushes an element to the stack. The pall opcode -The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
     pint The pint opcode
The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line. The pint opcode

1. pint
Implement the pint opcode.
The pint opcode
The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.


2. pop The pop opcode
The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

3. swap The swap opcode
The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

4. add The add opcode
The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

5. nop The nop opcode
The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

6. sub The sub opcode
The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

7. div The div opcode
The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

8. mul The mul opcode
The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

9. mod The mod opcode
The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

10. Comments
 Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).

11. pchar The pchar opcode
The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack

12. pstr The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

13. rotl The rotl opcode
The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

14. rotr The rotr opcode
The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

15. stack, queue The stack opcode
The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program

16. Brainfck Write a Brainfck script that prints School, followed by a new line.
All your Brainfck files should be stored inside the bf sub directory You can install the bf interpreter to test your code: sudo apt-get install bf Read: Brainfck

17. Add two digits Add two digits given by the user.
Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)

18. Multiplication Multiply two digits given by the user.
Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result The result of the multiplication will be one digit-long (<10)

19. Multiplication level up Multiply two digits given by the user.
